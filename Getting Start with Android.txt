Welcome to the exciting world of Android development!

In this course we'll learn how to build Android apps, including how to create user interfaces, communicate with a backend
 server, and take advantage of device features.

In the first week, we'll focus on the basics of Android user interfaces. We'll start by exploring how to create a new 
project, use standard Android development tools, customize how things look, provide navigation through an app, and 
display information. Just like learning any new toolset, there is an awful lot of information and context required to 
get up and running.
